# WAV in C
## Instructions on Use
This is a collection of C programs that create valid .wav files from C code.

To use, copy a file and modify it according to the waveforms (cosine is preferred)

Then build it with:
`gcc wav_builder_program.c -lm`

and run the resulting Machine Language file:
`./a.out`

This will output a WAVE file that contains your music!
